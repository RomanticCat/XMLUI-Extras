{"name":"XMLUI-Extras","tagline":"Extensions for DSpace XMLUI","body":"# Extensions for DSpace XMLUI\r\n\r\nThis repository contains extension code for https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace specific to XMLUI.\r\n\r\n#  How to use this\r\n\r\nThere are three steps to using XMLUI-Extras in your DSpace repository.\r\n\r\n## Obtain, build and install the API-Extras code\r\n\r\nThe XMLUI-Extras code depends on another DSpace extension module published by the IRR Team at the University of Waikato, API-Extras. Follow the [instructions](http://uow-irrs.github.io/API-Extras/#obtain-build-and-install-the-code) for obtaining, building and installing the API-Extras code, choosing the version of API-Extras required by your selected version of XMLUI-Extras.\r\n\r\n## Obtain, build and install the code\r\n\r\nThen you will need to download, build and install the XMLUI-Extras maven module on the computer where you're intending to build DSpace. Take care to download a version of XMLUI-Extras that is compatible with your DSpace version (look at the version of the dspace-api dependency in this project's pom.xml file). You will typically want to check out one of the tags (released versions) of XMLUI-Extras rather than just master. At the top level of this project's source tree, run `mvn package install`. This will place the xmlui-extras-VERSION.jar file in your local maven cache.\r\n\r\n## Pull XMLUI-Extras into DSpace\r\n\r\nThen you will need to pull the XMLUI-Extras module into DSpace. In your DSpace source tree, edit the `dspace/modules/xmlui/pom.xml` file. At the top of the existing dependencies section, you will need to insert a new dependency block.\r\n````\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>nz.ac.waikato.its</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>xmlui-extras</artifactId>\r\n            <version>VERSION</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n````\r\nInstead of VERSION, put in the version of XMLUI-Extras you built in the first step. Make any other changes to actually use the features in XMLUI-Extras (eg, add aspect configuration to `dspace/config/xmlui.xconf`). Finally, rebuild DSpace.","google":"UA-62467742-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
